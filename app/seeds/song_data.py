                Riin' up, back on the street
                Did my time, took my chances
                Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet
                Just a man and his will to survive
                So many times, it happens too fast
                You trade your passion for glory
                Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past
                You must fight just to keep them alive
                It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
                Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Face to face, out on the heat
                Hangin' tough, stayin' hungry
                They stack the odds still we take to the street
                For the kill, with the skill to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
                Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                Risin' up, straight to the top
                Had the guts, got the glory
                Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop
                Just a man and his will to survive
                It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight
                Risin' up to the challenge of our rival
                And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night
                And he's watching us all with the eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger
                The eye of the tiger

                … There's a story in my eyes
                Turn the pages of desire
                Now it's time to trade those dreams
                For the rush of passion's fire
                I can feel you tremble when we touch
                And I feel the hand of fate
                Reaching out to both of us
                I've been holding back the night
                I've been searching for a clue from you
                I'm gonna try with all my might
                To make this story line come true
                Can ya feel me tremble when we touch
                Can ya feel the hand of fate
                Reaching out to both of us
                This love affair can't wait
                … I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
                (I can't hold back)
                You voice explodes inside my head
                I can't hold back, I won't back down
                Girl it's too late to turn back now
                … Another shooting star goes by
                And in the night the silence speaks to you and I
                And now the time has come at last
                Don't let the moment run too fast
                I can feel you tremble when we touch
                And I feel the hand of fate reaching out to both of us
                There's a story in my eyes, turn the pages of desire
                Now it's time to trade those dreams
                For the rush of passion's fire
                … I can't hold back, I'm on the edge
                (I can't hold back)
                You voice explodes inside my head
                I can't hold back, I won't back down
                Girl it's too late to turn back now
